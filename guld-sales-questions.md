## What is Guld?

A new decentralized internet where users control their own data and digital identity to empower and automate real human contracts we use everyday. 
With security rooted in real human interactions, Guld is a new concept of Cryptographic Network which allows for the human management & validation of identities, addresses & devices for efficient and secure execution of human contracts. 


## Why are we doing this?

Fostering trust.
The internet as we know it today is rife with identity and other data theft, which out of necessity breeds distrust between participants on the network. 
Guld enables the internet to better support the secure executions of human contracts. We propose this human consensus network, with cryptographic security & identity verification allowing people to take back control of their data and their digital identities.


## How does it work?

Guld provides a name-registration service connecting names to digital identities through PGP on a public ledger. We do this through GULD tokens. 
GULD tokens are used to register the names on the network, designed for management of contracts. GULD is burned for registrations of other names for blockchains, ERC20 tokens, addresses & devices (i.e. mobile phones). In addition, GULD is issued in meritocratic fashion to individuals or groups who contribute to the Guld network.


## Blocktree vs Blockchain

Though similar in some ways to the blockchain, our blocktree infrastructure is better in many ways.

Similarities:

- Both are immutable, & each change builds off previous change over linear time.
-	Both are public records. Not all parts of the Guld blocktree are public, however the ledger is public. The difference: A blockchain is linear, whereas a blocktree, in data-structure terms, is a tree.
- The tree has a root and an arbitrary number of branches (folders) & leaves (data items, i.e., files). A given branch can have arbitrary number of sub-branches, and so on, ad infinitum.

Why the blocktree is better than blockchain:

- Blocktree can host an infinite number of blockchains
- Efficient scalability
- Controlled security
- Lower technological overhead cost


## The Guld Network

A decentralized, human consensus-based system built on Git where all transactions are validated using PGP encryption & signatures. 
Participants in the networks are called witnesses, as they are observers & validators of events, transactions & contracts. The main difference between Guld & other networks is that the Guld network is fully-witnessed. 
Each witness on the network maintains a perspective of events through their own files & information. Cryptographic hashes declare the integrity of the witnessâ€™ perspective ensuring trust & security logged through time.


## Who Can Use the Guld Network?

People, groups, devices, and entire blockchains can all be registered on the Guld network.

**Note!** Parties located in North Korea or Iran are not permitted to participate in the Guld network.

## Current Status of Guld

As of today, obtaining GULD is entirely peer to peer, meaning that the OTC market is direct sales from GULD owners to GULD buyers. Transactions are fulfilled through our Telegram Guld bot, GAI. This can be done in private conversations with the bot, or in groups witnessed by all participants in the transaction. In addition to this, we're close to releasing an automated sales channel where users can buy GULD directly, these developments will be shared in this telegram channel and through all of our online presence.

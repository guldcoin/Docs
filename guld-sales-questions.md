## What is Guld?

Guld is a new concept of Cryptographic Network, with its security rooted in real human interactions. It allows for the management and validation of identities, addresses, and devices to allow for efficient and secure execution of human contracts.

Participants in the networks are called witnesses, as they are observers and validators of events, transactions, and contracts. The main difference between Guld and other networks is that the Guld network is _fully-witnessed_.

## Why are we doing this?

The Internet as we know it today is rife with identity and other data theft, and of necessity breeds distrust between participants on the network.

Enable the internet to better support the secure execution of human contracts.

We propose a human consensus network, with cryptographic security and identity verification. We aim to allow people to take back control of their data and their digital identities.

## How does it work?

Guld is a name-registration service. GULD tokens are used to register names on the network, which is designed for management of contracts. Registrations of other names for blockchains, ERC20 tokens, addresses, and devices (like a mobile phone) will all burn GULD. In addition, GULD is also issued in meritocratic fashion to individuals or groups who contribute to the Guld network.

### Registration prices

Prices are as follows, in GULD:

Category|GULD Price|Limit

Individual|0.1|0
Group|0.1|0

Ledger|100|1
Individual chain address|0.1|1
Group chain address|1|10


## Blocktree vs Blockchain

For those familiar with the _blockchain_ concept, the blocktree serves a similar purpose in some regards, but goes much further.

First off, what's the same?

Both are **immutable**, and each change builds off the previous change over linear time.

Both are **public records**. Not all parts of the Guld _blocktree_ are public, but the _ledger_ is public.

Now, how do they differ?

**Branching structure.** A blockchain is _linear_, whereas a blocktree is, in data-structure terms, a tree. The tree has a root, and it has an arbitrary number of branches (folders) and leaves (data items, i.e., files). A given branch can have an arbitrary number of sub-branches, and so on, _ad infinitum_.


## The Guld Network

The Guld network is a decentralized, _consensus-based_ system. Each witness on the network maintains a perspective on their own files and information, the cryptographic hashes of which are the public expression of that witness' perspective. By participating in the network, each witness also validates the perspectives of the other members of the network.

The network is built on Git, and all transactions are validated using PGP encryption and signatures.

## Who Can Use the Guld Network?

People, groups, devices, and entire blockchains can all be registered on the Guld network.

**Note!** Parties located in North Korea or Iran are not permitted to participate in the Guld network.

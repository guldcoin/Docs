# Guld and the Blocktree

Guld is constructed around the concept of a _blocktree_. To quote the Guld whitepaper, a blocktree is "[a] polytree with signed, typed, symmetrical nodes [that] can be used to represent, record, compare, and perform operations on individual and group perspectives on any topic describable in a digitized record." In other words, it's a tree structure to hold all manner of data.



## Blocktree vs Blockchain

For those familiar with the _blockchain_ concept, the blocktree serves a similar purpose in some regards, but goes much, much further.

# Guld and the Blocktree

The Guld ecosystem is constructed around the concept of a _blocktree_. To quote the Guld whitepaper, a blocktree is "[a] polytree with signed, typed, symmetrical nodes [that] can be used to represent, record, compare, and perform operations on individual and group perspectives on any topic describable in a digitized record." In other words, it's a tree structure to hold all manner of data.

This is a _consensus-based_ system. That means that, at some level (really, at various levels), users/participants in the system need to come to agreement on what is _true_ within the system.

So how does this relate to the idea of _digital identity management_? At a practical level, it means that you are the sole arbiter of truth for everything contained in your part of the blocktree. For a group, truth is determined by consensus of equity-holders in the group.

The Guld ledger is designed for identity management, rather than privacy; thus, all usernames and transactions are public records.

## Blocktree vs Blockchain

For those familiar with the _blockchain_ concept, the blocktree serves a similar purpose in some regards, but goes much further.

First off, what's the same?

**Immutability**  Both are immutable, and each change builds off the previous change over linear time.

**Public records** Both are public records. Not all parts of the Guld _blocktree_ are public, but the _ledger_ is public.

Now, how do they differ?

**Branching structure** A blockchain is _linear_, whereas a blocktree is, in data-structure terms, a tree. The tree has a root, and it has an arbitrary number of branches (folders) and leaves (data items, i.e., files). A given branch can have an arbitrary number of sub-branches, and so on, _ad infinitum_.

As an (very-simplified) example, the files on a computer's hard drive are organized in a tree structure. The root of the structure is usually `C:\` in Windows, `Macintosh HD` on a Mac, and `/` on Unix and Linux. From that starting point, your own home directory might be `C:\Users\allison`, `Macintosh HD/Users/allison`, or `/home/allison`, respectively.

## Interacting with the Blocktree

Signing the commit that contains a transaction is the method by which you sign the transaction.

Transactions must be signed by the account being _debited_.
